* Introduction
  All the explorations, plans, things to be done to
  introduce computers as fun through doing stuff with
  raspberry pie and all other things related to it are
  captured here. 

* On Boarding
  Let us build media studio.  This is a hands-on project and
  does not require any programming.  Please follow these
  [[https://github.com/travula/mediamakerslides/blob/master/src/notes-from-dinesh.org][instructions]] and build the studio.

  Let us use issues on github for our communication.
